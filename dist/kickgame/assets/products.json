The upper is constructed from white leather with black support wings, a matching black heel tab with embossed Jumpman branding, and navy molded eyelets. A second Jumpman icon adorns the woven tongue tag in crimson. The sneaker rides on a two-tone polyurethane midsole, featuring encapsulated Air in the forefoot and a visible unit in the heel."

The all-leather upper features a crisp white base with contrasting black overlays and a matching black Swoosh. Nike branding lands on the heel tab and woven tongue tag in keeping with the sneaker's OG aesthetic. The low-top is supported by a durable rubber cupsole, equipped underfoot with a basketball-specific traction pattern.<br/>Size & Fit Men's Nike shoes tend to have an equal width between the forefoot and heel. Women's Nike shoes most often have a narrower heel than forefoot. Some women with a wider foot will often select men's shoes for comfort, because women's shoes are often more narrow than men's shoes. According to Nike, other fit differences between men and women's shoes include arch length and height."

			"description": "The adidas Yeezy Boost 700 'Faded Azure' treats the retro-inspired silhouette to a spirited makeover. A vibrant turquoise hue floods most of the upper, featuring a layered assemblage crafted from mesh, suede and leather. The monochromatic design is broken up by blue and tan mesh inserts atop the box, while reflective details add a hi-vis element to the layered build. Responsive cushioning arrives via a Boost midsole, housed within a sculpted PU carrier and made visible through cut-outs in the herringbone-traction rubber outsole. Size & Fit This style fits small to size, therefore we advise you to take half a size up from your regular size. If you are usually in-between sizes, we recommend you to take a full size up."
